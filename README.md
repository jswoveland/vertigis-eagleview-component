This project was bootstrapped with the [VertiGIS Studio Web SDK](https://github.com/vertigis/vertigis-web-sdk).

## IMPORTANT Update EagleView API Key ##

Prior to running the app, you must update the EagleView API key set in the app/app.json file.
Open app/app.json and search for "apiKey", and update the value to an EagleView API that works for "http://localhost:3001/"

## Available Scripts

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see build errors and warnings in the console.

### `npm run build`
